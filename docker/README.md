## docker

In this section there are all the docker imaged developed.

More in detail:

* old: old and not performant version of docker images
	* clear: images for a non-encrypted connection
	* enc: images for an encrypted connection
* sshXForwarding: an experiment to see how ssh X session forwarding words (efficient, easier to setup but too slow due to entire session, even if faked, forwarding)
* Libreoffice: The actual used Libreoffice image
