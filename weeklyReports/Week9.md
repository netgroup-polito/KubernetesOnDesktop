## Weekly report n°9 - Kubernetes on Desktop: offloading applications to a nearby worker node
​
Days of interest: 20/01/20 - 24/01/20
​
### Objective achieved
​
* Created a docker image with full audio support
* Completed the script to support all new features
* Completed deployment to support all new features
* Reorganized repository structure


### Current situation

With this release we have a complete running environment which supports both video and audio streaming. I have confirmed my intuition previously cited in the `architectures.md` where I described all the possible protocols to be used, suggesting to implement a VNC + PulseAudio solution.

### Next objectives

* Complete documentation according to the new standards

### Future improvements

* Finish the loadable kernel module
