## Weekly report n°8 - Kubernetes on Desktop: offloading applications to a nearby worker node
​
Days of interest: 12/01/20 - 17/01/20
​
### Objective achieved
​
* Video call with Riccardo Roccaro to explain the project
* Added timeout to script when waiting for the NodePort to be opened
* Added RDP deployment for the demo


### Current situation

As established, the project should be completed and ready to be presented to Netgroup. Due to exams, these weeks I'm dedicating all my time studying and unfortunately I was absent. We could fix a day for the presentation (maybe before the 12th of February). 

### Future improvement

* Accomplish PulseAudio audio redirection via TCP socket (clear) or TCP+SSH (encrypted)
