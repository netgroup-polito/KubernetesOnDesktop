## Weekly report nÂ°2 - Kubernetes on Desktop: offloading applications to a nearby worker node

Days of interest: 4/11/19 - 8/11/19

### Ongoing tasks

As suggested by the professor, I moved my attention to [Hooking the Linux System Call Table](https://tnichols.org/2015/10/19/Hooking-the-Linux-System-Call-Table/) topic.
In particular, using also my [Bachelor thesis](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/16837/1/magnani_simone_tesi.pdf), I studied how to implement an efficient and safe loadable kernel module which could address our needs.

About Alex suggestions concerning VNC client/server connections, I have not exploited it yet, but I will surely do it afterwards.


### Next objectives

* To finish the loadable kernel module
